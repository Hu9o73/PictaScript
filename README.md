# PictaScript
PictaScript is a deep learning project that combines CNN-based feature extraction with Transformer-based text generation to create accurate and context-aware image captions. Using a pre-trained ResNet50 for visual understanding and a GPT-2-inspired Transformer decoder, PictaScript transforms images into meaningful descriptions.
